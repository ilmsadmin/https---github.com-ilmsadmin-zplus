# API Gateway Implementation - Kong for Multi-Tenant System

This directory contains the implementation of the API Gateway for our multi-tenant system using Kong. The API Gateway serves as the single entry point for all client requests, handling routing, authentication, rate limiting, and other cross-cutting concerns.

## Architecture Overview

The API Gateway sits at the edge of our microservice architecture:

```
Client Requests
      |
      v
[External Load Balancer/Ingress]
      |
      v
  [API Gateway] --- Redis (caching, rate limiting)
      |   |        |
      |   |---------> Auth Service (JWT validation)
      |   |        |
      |   |---------> Tenant Service (domain resolution)
      |   
      v
[Microservices Backends]
  - User Service
  - Billing Service
  - Notification Service
  - File Service
  - Module Services (CRM, HRM, etc.)
```

## Key Features

- **Domain-based routing**: Directs traffic to the appropriate services based on hostname
- **Rate limiting**: Enforces limits based on tenant package type (basic/pro/enterprise)
- **JWT Authentication**: Validates tokens and ensures tenant context
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascading failures when downstream services are unavailable
- **Request/Response Transformation**: Modifies requests and responses as needed
- **TLS Termination**: Handles SSL certificates for all domains
- **Monitoring**: Exports metrics for Prometheus and logs for the ELK Stack

```

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster
- Helm (for Kong installation)
- PostgreSQL database for Kong
- Redis for rate limiting and caching
- SSL certificates management (cert-manager)

## High-Level Implementation Approach

1. **Kong Installation**: Deploy Kong using Helm chart with customized values
2. **Custom Plugin Development**: Develop plugins for tenant identification and JWT validation with tenant context
3. **Service Configuration**: Set up routes, services, and plugins in Kong
4. **Circuit Breaker Setup**: Configure health checks and circuit breaker thresholds
5. **Rate Limiting Setup**: Configure rate limits based on tenant packages
6. **Monitoring Integration**: Export metrics to Prometheus and logs to ELK Stack
7. **Documentation**: Generate OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

## Deployment and Scaling

The API Gateway is designed to scale horizontally to handle increasing load. Multiple replicas can be deployed behind a load balancer for high availability.
